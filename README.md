# Pharmacogenomics Variant Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes genetic variants associated with drug response
to identify clinically relevant pharmacogenomic markers.

## Objectives
- Identify SNPs affecting drug metabolism
- Map variants to drug–gene interactions
- Generate interpretable output for PGx reporting

## Input Data
- CSV file containing SNP genotypes
- Source: Public databases / curated datasets

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing
2. Variant filtering
3. Functional annotation
4. Drug–gene association analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- GitHub
- Public PGx databases (e.g., PharmGKB)

## Output
- Processed variant table (CSV)
- Summary report of drug response associations

## How to Run
```bash
python scripts/analysis.py
